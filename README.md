# Examples of different ways to style background images

## Description

This project was started as a way to demonstrate how background-images can be styled, as a classmate had asked about styling background images using the repeat property, then had given up on being able to do so.

Click on a button to show a different way of styling a background image. (I hope to add code snippets that popup for the corresponding styling.)

This is a work-in-progress, starting with a background image that covers the full screen and adapts with the screen sized and another background image set to repeat. This project provides me with the opportunity to practice both CSS and JavaScript.

## Resources

[CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/), [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/), and [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) have been helpful for showing how the code is written.
